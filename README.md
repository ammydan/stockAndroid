## stockAndroid
This Project is an extended mobile app version of Homework 6 and Homework 8.
In this exercise, you will develop an Android application, which allows users to search for different stock symbols/tickers and look at the detailed information about them. Additionally, the users can trade with virtual money and create a portfolio. Users can also favorite stock symbols to track their stock prices. The App contains 2 screens: Home screen and the Detailed Stock Information screen. However, the App has multiple features on each of these screens.
This project contains 5 API calls. There are 4 calls to the tiingo APIs for company description, stock prices, autocomplete and chart data points, and the additional newsapi endpoint. Each of these 5 API calls are the same as [StockWeb](https://github.com/ammydan/stockWeb).

you should download or git clone the project.

###### 3. open it in Anroid Studio and run it in Emulator
